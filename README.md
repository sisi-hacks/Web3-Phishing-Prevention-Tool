Introduction
Phishing attacks are one of the most common threats in the Web3 space, where users often interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets that require them to sign transactions or connect accounts. The Web3 Phishing Prevention Tool is designed to address this issue by providing a multi-layered verification system that ensures the legitimacy of URLs, smart contracts, and domains.

This tool combines domain analysis, SSL certificate validation, heuristic-based detection, and crowdsourced reporting to protect users from scams and fraudulent sites.

Features
Domain Verification: Check if the URL belongs to a legitimate domain.
Smart Contract Validation: Ensure the URL interacts with the correct smart contract address.
SSL Certificate Checks: Confirm the site uses HTTPS and has a valid SSL certificate.
Heuristic Detection: Analyze the URL for suspicious patterns (e.g., typosquatting, redirects).
Crowdsourced Reporting: Allow users to report suspicious URLs for community review.
Real-Time Alerts: Notify users instantly when they encounter a potentially malicious site.
Cross-Chain Support: Verify domains and contracts across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).
